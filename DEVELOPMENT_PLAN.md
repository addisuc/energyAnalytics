## **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

1. **Build locally first** - Test each feature thoroughly
2. **Incremental deployment** - Deploy working features progressively  
3. **Feature flags** - Enable/disable features by subscription tier
4. **A/B testing** - Test UI/UX improvements
5. **User feedback loop** - Collect and implement user suggestions
